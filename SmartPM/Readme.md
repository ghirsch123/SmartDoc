# SmartPM

## To Run
1. In terminal navigate to the SmartPM folder
2. Run "python SmartPM.py" in line
3. Then when the tikz window pops up, click "Run the Procedure". At any time, you can exit and save your data. When coming back and running the procedure again, the program will pick up from where you left off.
4. Once finished with the procedure, close and save it, then click "Generate the Report." This will generate a .tex and .pdf file of the procedure.

## Notes
At any point you can click on "Expert Mode" in the tikz window. This allows you to edit the order of each step, as well as enter your information all at once rather than clicking through each step.
