# allowlist default files license, ignore, and readme.
# I am using an allowlist instead of a blocklist because:
# 1. To many files, just visual studio is creating .fdb, .fls, .syctex.gz, etc... I dont want to figure out every weird file that all these convinient tools are creating, I just want to focus on the core elements.
